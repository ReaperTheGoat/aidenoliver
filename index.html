    <h2>Why is Water Important?</h2>
    <p>Water is not just a resource; it is the heartbeat of our planet. Every human, every animal, every plant, every ecosystem depends on it. Without clean water, communities collapse, children fall ill, crops fail, and entire regions face famine.</p>

    <h2>The Global Water Crisis 🌍</h2>
    <p>According to the United Nations, more than <b>2 billion people</b> do not have access to safe drinking water. By 2050, nearly half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas if we do not act now. Cities run dry, rivers shrink, and groundwater disappears faster than nature can replenish it.</p>
    <p>Wasting water is not just about higher bills—it is about taking away from those who already struggle daily to fill a bucket or walk kilometers to the nearest well.</p>

    <h2>South Africa’s Water Struggle 🇿🇦</h2>
    <p>In South Africa, water scarcity is already a daily reality. Cities like Cape Town nearly ran out of water during the 2018 "Day Zero" crisis. Farmers across the country battle droughts that destroy crops and livestock. Climate change makes rainfall less predictable, while growing cities put more pressure on our limited water supply.</p>
    <p>Every time we leave the tap running, we risk making the next "Day Zero" come sooner.</p>

        <h3>Fix Leaks</h3>
        <p>A dripping tap can waste over 10,000 liters of water a year. Fixing leaks is the simplest step we can take at home.</p>

        <h3>Use Buckets</h3>
        <p>Wash your car or water your plants with a bucket instead of a hose. A hosepipe can waste hundreds of liters in minutes.</p>

        <h3>Reuse Water</h3>
        <p>Reuse greywater (like from washing dishes or laundry) for gardens or flushing toilets where possible.</p>

        <h3>Take Short Showers</h3>
        <p>Cutting your shower time by just 2 minutes can save up to 20 liters of water each day.</p>

    <h2>Our Shared Responsibility ✨</h2>
    <p>Saving water is not just about today—it is about tomorrow. Every glass we drink, every river we swim in, every rainstorm that fills our dams is part of a bigger cycle. The choices we make now will decide if future generations grow up in a world where water is abundant or scarce.</p>
